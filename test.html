<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span>Advantage</span></h3>

<li><span>It does not require much expertise, just choose the model of your choice well</span></li>
<li><span>There are kits for "newbies" so there is no excessive difficulty in acquiring the one that best suits your needs.</span></li>
<li><span>Its price is relatively cheap compared to other sex toys.</span></li>

<li><span>It is a magnificent option, especially in the double-ended presentation, since it more than fulfills its mission.&nbsp;Conventional double ended vibrators are not specifically created for anal penetration and in most cases their model is "generic".</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span>Disadvantages</span></h3>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span>Requires batteries or to be recharged like any other vibrator</span></li>
<li><span>In addition to the above, it strictly requires the use of lubricant due to the nature of the anus (it does not lubricate).</span></li>
<li><span>It can be detrimental to the user if he does not choose the right model for the size of his area.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span>You should buy an anal vibrator</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>There are a range of reasons why you should buy an anal vibrator.&nbsp;In the first place, it is an extra stimulant for the couple's adventure, any girl who wants to enter the world of anal pleasure and show her boy how daring she is.&nbsp;Here is a specific list:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span>You want to experience new sensations</span></li>
<li><span>You enjoy good anal sex and want to improve your dilation</span></li>
<li><span>You are new or new to anal sex (or you have no experience at all) and you want to start little by little.</span></li>
<li><span>You want to give your partner more pleasure or increase that "&nbsp;</span><em><span>passionate flame</span></em><span>&nbsp;" that unites you with your boy.</span></li>
<li><span>For guys in particular, it's a great way to stimulate the prostate.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span>You should NOT buy an anal vibrator if</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The main&nbsp;</span><strong><span>reasons why the user should not buy</span></strong><span>&nbsp;an anal vibrator are based on the fact that they will not have full enjoyment in practice.&nbsp;For these reasons, read the following list, as it will help you a lot and it will be a better idea to opt for another type of sex toy.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span>You hate anal sex (you can't stand or tolerate pain).</span></li>
<li><span>You have hemorrhoid problems or some type of condition in the colon.</span></li>
<li><span>You have some kind of allergy or aversion to synthetic lubricants.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span>Usage tips for women</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>These tips will help you a lot, especially at the time of your "first time" with this type of sex toy, so take note and apply them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>First of all, the dilation of the anus is very different from that of the vagina, since the opening in this area does not produce lubrication and the nerve ending must be stimulated very carefully to avoid damage.&nbsp;So when you buy your first anal vibrator, start with just the "tip," making small circular motions at the entrance to the anus.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Another very useful piece of advice is to get a good lubricant, since as we have mentioned throughout this guide, it is essential for a good and pleasant penetration.&nbsp;Additionally, start with the "small", the simple, and the least sophisticated products so you know which one suits your needs.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span>Usage tips for men</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>As a man, exploring the behavior of your anus towards certain stimuli is essential, so it is best to use a small-sized anal vibrator with a good lubricant that promotes dilation.&nbsp;Because the prostate is stimulated during penetration, it is also very important to choose a model with a soft tip, in order not to cause possible damage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The anal vibrator is a complement for the couple or alone and you should not fall into social prejudices, since contrary to "old" beliefs, its use is not only limited to homosexual couples.&nbsp;It is an unconditional device when it comes to achieving a good orgasm and discovering new forms of pleasure.</span></p>
